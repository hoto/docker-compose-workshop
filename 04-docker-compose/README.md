# Docker compose

Build and run:

    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up
    
Go to:
    
    localhost:8080
    
Clean up:
    
    docker-compose down
    
For comparison you can run:
    
    bash docker-run.sh
    
See that the outcome is exactly the same as when using docker-compose.
(Besides `nodemon` which is not used here, figure it out yourselves how to do it!)
